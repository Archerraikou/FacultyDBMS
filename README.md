# FacultyDBMS

Concepts used:

1. Tables, entries, primary keys, foreign keys, constraints.
2. Data types: indexed tables, nested tables, varrays, records, objects.
3. Cursors: standard cursors, parametrised cursors, reference cursors, cursor-expressions.
4. Procedures, functions, parameters.
5. Packages.
6. Errors.

Project requirements:

1. Present the database's utility.
2. Create the ERD (Entity-Relationship Diagram).
3. Starting from the ERD, create the Conceptual Diagram of the model, integrating all the needed attribuites.
4. Implement the Conceptual Diagram in Oracle: define all tables and add constraints (primary keys, foreign keys, etc).
5. Add coherent data in the created tables (minimum 5 entries for each independent entity, minimum 10 entries for each associative entity).
6. Formulate a problem in natural language that you can solve by using an independently stored subprogram that uses all 3 studied collection types (indexed tables, nested tables, varrays).
7. Formulate a problem in natural language that you can solve by using an independently stored subprogram that uses a minimum of 2 different types of studied cursors, one of them being a parametrised cursor, depending on the other one.
8. Formulate a problem in natural language that you can solve by using a function that uses a minimum of 3 tables in the same SQL command. Treat all exceptions that can appear, including the predefined exceptions NO_DATA_FOUND and TOO_MANY_ROWS.
9. Formulate a problem in natural language that you can solve by using a procedure that has 2 parameters and uses a minimum of 5 tables in the same SQL command. Define a minimum of 2 custom exceptions, others than the ones predefined by the system.
10. Define a command-level LMD trigger.
11. Define a line-level LMD trigger.
12. Define an LDD trigger.
13. Formulate a problem in natural language that you can solve by using a package that includes complet data types and object needed for an integrated action flux, specific to the defined database (minimul of 2 data types, 2 functions, 2 procedures).
